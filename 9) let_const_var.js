let firstName = "Silson";
const _firstName = "Sapkota";
var __firstName = "Silllson";

// The main difference between let and const is we can re-assign/change the value of let. but we cant change the value of const because its suuposed to be a constant value.

firstName =  "Silson2"; // Changing value of let firstName = "Silson";
_firstName = "Silson2"; // This wont work because its constant value and is immutable.

// Var is pretty much the same as let but it was introduced way back in ES5. It should be avoided now.

/*
-JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. 

-Javascript is used by programmers across the world to create dynamic and interactive web content like applications and browsers. JavaScript is so popular that it's the most used programming language in the world, used as a client-side programming language by 97.0% of all websites. 


-In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags.
    for e.g (In .html file) -->

        <script>
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript";
        </script>

-Old JavaScript examples may use a type attribute:
     <script type="text/javascript">.
    The type attribute is not required. JavaScript is the default scripting     language in HTML.

-You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.

-Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.
